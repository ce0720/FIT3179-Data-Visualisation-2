      From the choropleth map above, we can observe that majorities of the countries nowadays are having an <span class = "red">unhealthy CO2 emission rate</span>, which is more than <span class = "red">2.3 metric tons </span>per capita.
      Developing countries such as the United States, Canada, and China are having a <span class = "red">relatively high </span>emission, which is more than the <span class = "red">8.8 metric tons</span>.<br><br>

      <p></p>As the global <span class = "green">temperature increases</span>, the sea levels in the world has been <span class = "green">increased directly proportional</span> over time. We can see that the Sea Level Change have
    reaches <span class = "green">71 </span>which indicates that the ice in both north and south pole are <span class = "green">melting</span> in a fast speed. </p> <br>
     The rapid changes of sea levels also indicates that <span class = "green">global warming issues</span> are currently <span class = "green">not being resolved</span> yet. Further actions should be taken by leading countries

  <p> Based on the stacked bar chart, we can see that the <span class = "blue">Annual Surface Temperature change</span> for these recent <span class = "blue">5 years </span>are very high which is <span class = "blue">more than 6Â°C </span>changes in just different 5 countries.
    Among all of the countries in the bar chart, <span class = "blue">Russia></span> has the <span class = "blue">highest temperature</span> change among the other 5 countries. Based on the heatmap which
    provides information about temeprature change in US, we can see that <span class = "blue">temperature change</span> is getting higher in recent years. During <span class = "blue">January to March</span>,
    we can observe that the temperature change is <span class = "blue">higher</span> than other months because it might be due to <span class = "blue">winter season</span> where temperature falls and drops quickly.
